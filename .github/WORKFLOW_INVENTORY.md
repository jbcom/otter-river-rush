# Complete Workflow & Automation Inventory

## ✅ Current Workflows (Reorganized)

### Core Workflows
1. **`integration.yml`** - Integration tests and checks
2. **`web.yml`** - Web platform build and deployment
3. **`mobile.yml`** - Mobile platform build and deployment
4. **`desktop.yml`** - Desktop platform build and deployment
5. **`release.yml`** - Release automation

## 🤖 Other Automation

### Renovate (Dependency Updates)
- **Location**: `/renovate.json` (root level)
- **Status**: ✅ Active and configured
- **Features**:
  - Groups GitHub Actions updates
  - Groups minor/patch updates
  - Separates major updates
  - Runs weekly (Mondays before 6am UTC)
  - Creates dependency dashboard
  - Security vulnerability alerts
  - Semantic commits enabled

**Configuration looks good!** Renovate will automatically:
- Update GitHub Actions in our new workflows
- Group dependency PRs logically
- Use conventional commits (compatible with semantic-release)

### Semantic Release
- **Integrated in**: `release.yml` workflow
- **Status**: ✅ Configured
- **Creates**: Version tags, CHANGELOG.md, GitHub releases

## ❌ Workflows NOT Needed (Common but Unnecessary Here)

### Dependabot
- **Status**: Not configured (using Renovate instead)
- **Reason**: Renovate is more powerful and already configured
- **Action**: None needed - Renovate handles this

### CodeQL / Security Scanning
- **Status**: Not configured
- **Consider adding?** Could be useful for a public game
- **Would add**: Automated security vulnerability scanning

### Stale Issue/PR Management
- **Status**: Not configured
- **Consider adding?** Depends on project activity
- **Would add**: Auto-close stale issues/PRs

### Performance Testing
- **Status**: Not configured
- **Consider adding?** Could be useful for game performance
- **Would add**: Automated performance benchmarks

### Preview Deployments
- **Status**: Not configured
- **Consider adding?** Could deploy PRs to preview URLs
- **Would add**: Preview each PR's changes

## 🔮 Recommended Additional Workflows

### 1. ~~Test Builds Workflow~~ ✅ ADDED!
**Purpose**: Build platform binaries without creating a release  
**Use case**: Test Android/Desktop builds before release  
**Priority**: HIGH (addresses untested builds issue)  
**Status**: ✅ Created as `test-builds.yml`

### 2. Security Scanning Workflow (Recommended)
**Purpose**: CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities  
**Use case**: Public game security  
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### 3. Bundle Size Tracking (Optional)
**Purpose**: Track web bundle size over time  
**Use case**: Performance monitoring  
**Priority**: LOW (already reporting size in CI)

### 4. Nightly Builds (Optional)
**Purpose**: Test latest commits overnight  
**Use case**: Catch integration issues early  
**Priority**: LOW

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

| Workflow | Before | After | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| CI/CD (monolith) | ❌ 372 lines | ✅ Removed | Deleted |
| CI | ❌ Mixed with CD | ✅ 210 lines | Created |
| Deploy | ❌ Mixed with CI | ✅ 70 lines | Created |
| Release | ❌ Mixed with CI | ✅ 70 lines | Created |
| Platform Builds | ✅ Separate | ✅ 145 lines | Updated |
| Test Builds | ❌ Didn't exist | ✅ 245 lines | Created |
| Renovate | ✅ Active | ✅ Active | Unchanged |

## 🎯 Summary

**You have all essential workflows!** The reorganization addressed:
- ✅ Redundancy eliminated
- ✅ Top-heavy ci-cd.yml removed
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Proper documentation

**Other automation is minimal but appropriate:**
- Renovate handles dependency updates
- Semantic-release handles versioning
- No unnecessary complexity

**Consider adding** (optional):
1. Test builds workflow (for manual platform testing)
2. Security scanning (CodeQL)
3. Preview deployments (for PRs)

But the current setup is solid and well-organized!
