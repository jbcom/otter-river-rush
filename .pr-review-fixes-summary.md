# PR Review Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues from Gemini Code Assist Review

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. ✅ Animation Loop Fixed (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Issue:** `playLaneSwitchAnimation` created its own animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` with hardcoded 16ms delta time, running independently of the main game loop.

**Fix:** 
- Refactored to store animation state in `laneTransition` object
- Added `updateAnimation(deltaTime)` method to be called by main GameLoop
- Now uses frame-rate independent movement with provided deltaTime

**Files Changed:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 1275-1430)

---

#### 2. ✅ Speed Rush Mode Naming Fixed (DESIGN.md)
**Issue:** Persona mentioned "Speed Rush Mode" which didn't exist in the game modes section.

**Fix:** Changed to "Time Trial Mode" which is actually defined (line 269-285).

**Files Changed:** `docs/DESIGN.md` (line 118)

---

#### 3. ✅ Unavoidable Pattern Clarified (DESIGN.md)
**Issue:** "Unavoidable pattern" contradicted the architecture's fairness principle.

**Fix:** Changed to "Mistake or increasing difficulty" to clarify the game doesn't generate impossible scenarios.

**Files Changed:** `docs/DESIGN.md` (line 222)

---

#### 4. ✅ Leaderboard Contradiction Resolved (DESIGN.md)
**Issue:** Time Trial Mode said "Leaderboard-focused: Global rankings" but elsewhere specified local-only for privacy.

**Fix:** Updated to "Leaderboard-focused: Local rankings (privacy-first)" for consistency.

**Files Changed:** `docs/DESIGN.md` (line 278)

---

#### 5. ✅ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Implemented (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Issue:** Game design specified DDA but architecture didn't include any system for it.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive DDA system to ProceduralGenerator:
- `recordDeath()` - tracks recent deaths and scales back difficulty if player struggling
- `recordSuccessfulDodge()` - scales up difficulty for skilled players
- `increasePowerUpSpawnRate()` - spawns more power-ups when player struggling
- `difficultyMultiplier` property to modify base difficulty

**Files Changed:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 428-431, 471-515)

---

#### 6. ✅ Success Metrics Fixed (DESIGN.md)
**Issue:** "Recommendation: % who tell friends (NPS equivalent)" conflicted with privacy-first principles (no tracking/accounts).

**Fix:** Replaced with "Session Quality: Average session length and games per session (indicates enjoyment)" which can be measured locally without tracking users.

**Files Changed:** `docs/DESIGN.md` (line 579)

---

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 7. ✅ Unused Property Removed (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Issue:** `howl` property in AudioSystem was declared but never used.

**Fix:** Removed the dead code.

**Files Changed:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (line 1174)

---

#### 8. ✅ Entity Removal Optimized (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Issue:** `removeEntity()` used `splice()` which is O(n) - performance bottleneck for many entities.

**Fix:** Implemented swap-and-pop pattern for O(1) removal:
```typescript
this.entities[index] = this.entities[this.entities.length - 1];
this.entities.pop();
```

**Files Changed:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 225-230)

---

#### 9. ✅ CSS Text-Stroke Already Correct (BRAND_IDENTITY.md)
**Issue:** Reported that `-webkit-text-stroke` was needed.

**Status:** Already correctly using `-webkit-text-stroke` prefix (line 162).

---

#### 10. ✅ CSS Syntax Clarified (BRAND_IDENTITY.md)
**Issue:** Code block used SCSS syntax (`&:hover`) but was marked as `css`.

**Fix:** Changed code fence language from `css` to `scss` to accurately reflect the syntax.

**Files Changed:** `docs/BRAND_IDENTITY.md` (line 253)

---

## Additional Fix from User Request

### ✅ SaveSystem Deep Merge Bug (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Issue:** `SaveSystem.save()` performed shallow merge, overwriting nested objects. Calling `save({ settings: { musicVolume: 0.5 } })` would replace entire settings object, losing all other properties.

**Fix:** 
- Implemented `deepMerge()` utility method for recursive object merging
- Updated `save()` method to use deep merge instead of spread operator
- Added documentation comments and usage examples

**Files Changed:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 1043-1164)
