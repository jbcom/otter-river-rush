# Deep Alignment Audit - ARCHITECTURE.md vs Implementation

## Systems Required by ARCHITECTURE.md

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED:
1. Fixed timestep game loop (lines 114-148) - NOW FIXED ✅
2. SpatialGrid for collision (lines 254-315) - EXISTS in CollisionDetector.ts ✅
3. Object pooling (lines 1457-1510) - EXISTS in ObjectPool.ts ✅
4. Deep merge save system (lines 1086-1119) - NOW FIXED ✅

### ❌ MISSING - Critical Architecture Components:

#### 1. Layered Rendering System (lines 677-788)
**Spec**: Multiple canvas layers (BACKGROUND, BACKGROUND_OBJECTS, WATER, GAME_ENTITIES, PARTICLES, UI, OVERLAY)
**Actual**: Single canvas in Renderer.ts - uses clearRect() and redraws everything
**Impact**: Performance optimization missing

#### 2. Full ECS Pattern (lines 158-244)
**Spec**: Component/System separation, Entity composition
**Actual**: Traditional OOP classes (Otter, Rock extend with methods)
**Impact**: Architecture mismatch

#### 3. Audio Sprite System (lines 1240-1257)
**Spec**: Single audio file with sprite sheet mapping
```typescript
sprite: {
  coin: [0, 200],
  gem: [200, 300],
  ...
}
```
**Actual**: Need to verify AudioManager.ts implementation

#### 4. DDA (Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment) (lines 488-519)
**Spec**: 
- Track recent deaths (last 60s)
- Scale difficulty based on performance
- Increase power-up spawn when struggling
**Actual**: Need to verify if ProceduralGenerator has full DDA

#### 5. Tutorial Zone - First 30s Invincible (DESIGN.md line 511)
**Spec**: "First 30 seconds: Cannot die (tutorial zone)"
**Actual**: NOT FOUND in Game.ts collision check

#### 6. Near-Miss Detection & Scoring (DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md lines 628-639)
**Spec**: Detect and reward close calls to obstacles
**Actual**: Partial - achievements reference it but no implementation in Game.ts

#### 7. Combo System with 2s Window (ARCHITECTURE.md lines 641-659)
**Spec**: 2 second window to maintain combo, multiplier at 10+
**Actual**: EXISTS but uses 3s window (line 58: `COMBO_TIMEOUT = 3000`)

#### 8. Frame Budget Management (ARCHITECTURE.md lines 1543-1569)
**Spec**: Track frame time, manage performance budget
**Actual**: NOT FOUND

## DESIGN.md Gaps

### ❌ MISSING Features:

1. **Tutorial System** (line 511): 30s invincibility for new players
2. **Near-Miss Rewards** (line 628): Points for close dodges  
3. **Pattern-Based Generation** (lines 418-567): Predefined obstacle patterns, not pure random
4. **Biome-Specific Audio** (lines 393-411): Different music per biome
5. **Lane Switch Animation** (ARCHITECTURE.md lines 1418-1449): Tilt/rotation during lane change
6. **Power-Up Stacking** UI (DESIGN.md): Show multiple active power-ups

## Next Steps

I need to implement:
1. Tutorial zone invincibility
2. Near-miss detection and scoring
3. Verify pattern-based generation exists
4. Fix combo timeout to 2s
5. Add proper layered rendering or document why single canvas
6. Implement DDA fully
7. Fix all lint errors
