# CI/CD Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Identified Critical Gap
- **Issue:** AI-generated content (level patterns, enemy AI, sprites) was NOT being regenerated in CI/CD
- **Impact:** Deployments used stale, manually-committed content
- **Risk:** Missing latest game improvements and asset updates

### 2. Created Content Generation Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/content-generation.yml`

**Features:**
- ✅ Runs weekly on schedule (Sundays 2 AM UTC)
- ✅ Can be triggered manually via Actions UI
- ✅ Called automatically by main CI/CD workflow on main branch
- ✅ Generates fresh content with Claude (Anthropic) and GPT-Image (OpenAI)
- ✅ Commits generated content back to repo
- ✅ Gracefully handles missing API keys (continues with committed files)
- ✅ Uploads artifacts for build job to use

**What It Generates:**
- Enemy AI behaviors and definitions
- Level obstacle patterns  
- Achievement definitions
- Loading screen tips
- Otter and obstacle sprites
- HUD elements and UI icons
- PWA app icons
- Optimized assets via asset pipeline

### 3. Integrated with Existing CI/CD
**File:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (modified)

**Changes:**
- Added `generate-content` job that runs before build on main branch
- Updated `build-web` to download generated content artifacts
- Ensures fresh content is always included in deployments

### 4. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**`.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md`** - Step-by-step guide for:
- Getting OpenAI and Anthropic API keys
- Adding secrets to GitHub repository
- Testing the setup
- Cost management strategies
- Troubleshooting

**`.github/workflows/README.md`** - Workflow architecture overview:
- How workflows connect and trigger each other
- Required secrets and permissions

Build (uses committed files) ⚠️ Potentially stale content
  ↓
Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

### AFTER
```

  ├─ Generate achievements (Claude)
  ├─ Generate sprites (OpenAI)
  ├─ Generate icons (OpenAI)
  ├─ Run asset pipeline
  └─ Commit & push changes
  ↓
CI (lint, test, type-check)
  ↓
Build (uses FRESH content) ✅
  ↓
E2E & Visual Tests
  ↓
Deploy to GitHub Pages ✅ Always fresh!
  ↓
Auto-release (if version bump)
  ↓
Platform Builds (Android, Desktop)
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### For Repository Maintainers

1. **Add API Keys** (one-time setup):
   ```
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   - OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-...
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = sk-ant-api03-...
   ```
   
   📖 See [`.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md`](.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

2. **That's it!** Content generates automatically on:
   - Every push to main
   - Every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
   - Manual trigger via Actions UI

### For Contributors

No changes needed! Your PRs will:
- Run CI checks (lint, test, type-check)
- Build successfully
- Content generation only runs after merge to main

### Manual Content Generation

If you want to regenerate content without pushing:

**Via GitHub Actions:**
```
Actions → Content Generation → Run workflow → Select main → Run workflow
```

**Locally:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

npm run generate-content      # Game data
npm run generate-sprites      # Sprites
npm run generate-hud          # HUD elements
npm run generate-ui-icons     # UI icons
npm run generate-pwa-icons    # PWA app icons
npm run asset-pipeline        # Optimize all
```

## 💰 Cost Impact

### Estimated Monthly Cost

| Service | Per Run | Runs/Month | Monthly |
|---------|---------|------------|---------|
| OpenAI | $1.50 | 4-6 | $6-9 |
| Anthropic | $0.15 | 4-6 | $0.60-0.90 |
| **Total** | | | **$7-10** |

### When It Runs
- ✅ Main branch pushes (typically 4-8/month)
- ✅ Weekly scheduled (4/month)
- ✅ Manual triggers (as needed)

### How to Reduce Costs
1. **Don't add the secrets** - workflows continue to work with committed files
2. **Disable scheduled runs** - comment out `schedule:` in content-generation.yml
3. **Only manual triggers** - remove `workflow_call`, keep only `workflow_dispatch`

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Game Quality
- ✅ **Always Fresh Content** - Latest AI-generated patterns and behaviors
- ✅ **Consistent Assets** - Asset pipeline ensures quality standards
- ✅ **No Manual Steps** - Reduces human error
- ✅ **Version Controlled** - All changes committed and traceable

### For Development
- ✅ **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
- ✅ **Resilient** - Works even without API keys
- ✅ **Transparent** - Clear logs and commit messages
- ✅ **Testable** - Manual trigger for experimentation

### For Deployment
- ✅ **Automated** - No manual intervention needed
- ✅ **Reliable** - Content generation failures don't break builds
- ✅ **Fast** - Runs in parallel with CI checks when possible
- ✅ **Traceable** - Every generation creates a commit

## 🚀 Phase 2 (Future)

The workflow analysis document also recommends splitting the monolithic `ci-cd.yml` into logical domains:

```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml              # Quality checks only
├── content-gen.yml     # ✅ DONE
├── build.yml           # Build artifacts
├── test-extended.yml   # E2E and visual
├── deploy-web.yml      # GitHub Pages
├── platform-builds.yml # ✅ EXISTS
└── release.yml         # Auto-release
```

**Benefits:**
- Better modularity and reusability
- Easier to maintain
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can reuse via `workflow_call`

**Priority:** Medium (nice to have, current setup works well)
