4. ✅ **Vite build path**: Relative path for production builds
5. ✅ **ESLint errors**: All incomplete implementations completed

### Testing Infrastructure:
6. ✅ **Composition tests**: Detect layout overlaps, white boxes, z-index issues
7. ✅ **Responsive tests**: 9 viewport sizes, portrait/landscape, touch targets
8. ✅ **Polling strategies**: Replace fixed timeouts with robust assertions
9. ✅ **Browser verification**: Real game playthrough validated

### Documentation:
10. ✅ **TESTING.md**: Comprehensive testing guide (accurate test stats)
11. ✅ **CI_CD_STATUS.md**: Pipeline documentation (correct 82% pass rate)
12. ✅ **Repository cleanup**: 10 redundant docs moved to memory-bank
