# React Three Fiber Migration Summary

## Overview
Complete architectural migration from Canvas 2D to React Three Fiber + GLB models in response to user feedback about quality limitations.

## What Was Changed

### Documentation
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete rewrite (v1.0.0 â†’ v2.0.0)
  - React Three Fiber as core rendering engine
  - GLB 3D models for all game entities
  - Ambient textures for scrolling backgrounds
  - Zustand for state management
  - WebGL rendering pipeline

- **README.md**: Updated to reflect new stack
  - React 19 + React Three Fiber 9
  - GLB asset pipeline
  - WebGL 3D rendering

### Key Architectural Changes

#### From Canvas 2D OOP to React Components
**Before:**
```typescript
class Otter {
  x: number
  y: number
  update(delta: number) { }
  render(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) { }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function Otter({ position }: OtterProps) {
  const { scene, animations } = useGLTF('/models/otter.glb')
  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    // Game loop logic
  })
  return <primitive object={scene} />
}
```

#### State Management
**Before:** Traditional OOP with class properties

**After:** Zustand centralized store
```typescript
const useGameStore = create((set) => ({
  player: { lane: 1, position: [0,0,2] },
  switchLane: (direction) => { /* ... */ }
}))
```

#### Asset Pipeline
**Before:** PNG sprites with Canvas drawImage()

**After:** GLB 3D models with Three.js
- Blender modeling workflow
- Draco compression
- KTX2 texture compression
- <200KB per model budget

### Preserved Patterns
âœ… Fixed timestep game loop (now in `useFrame`)
âœ… Tutorial zone invincibility (30s)
âœ… Near-miss detection (50 units)
âœ… Combo system (2s window)
âœ… Deep merge save system

## Benefits

1. **Visual Quality**: 3D models > 2D sprites
2. **Performance**: WebGL hardware acceleration
3. **Maintainability**: React component model
4. **Ecosystem**: @react-three/drei, postprocessing
5. **Modern Stack**: Aligns with current web game development

## Next Steps

### Implementation Phase
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei zustand
   npm install --save-dev @types/three
   ```

2. Create GLB models:
   - Otter.glb (swim animation)
   - Rock-1.glb, Rock-2.glb, Rock-3.glb
   - Coin.glb, Gem.glb
   - PowerUp-*.glb

3. Implement React components:
   - GameCanvas component
   - Otter component
   - Rock component
   - Collectible components
   - Environment component

4. Setup Zustand store:
   - Game state
   - Player state
   - Entity management
   - Actions (switchLane, collectCoin, etc.)

5. Migrate game logic:
   - Game loop in useFrame
   - Collision detection
   - Procedural generation
   - Score system

## Rationale

User feedback: *"if you and your predecessors are both fixating on this idea of building the game in 2D canvas I'm going to have to step in and manually override. It is REALLY impacting quality."*

The Canvas 2D approach was limiting visual fidelity and gameplay potential. React Three Fiber provides:
- Superior 3D visuals with GLB models
- Better performance through WebGL
- Modern React architecture
- Rich component ecosystem
- Industry-standard game development patterns

## Status

âœ… Architecture documentation complete (ARCHITECTURE.md v2.0.0)
âœ… README updated
âœ… All frozen docs aligned
ðŸ”„ Implementation pending (requires codebase refactor)

---

**This is a BREAKING architectural change that requires a complete codebase rewrite.**
