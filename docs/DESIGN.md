## 🎯 Core Game Vision

**Otter River Rush is a joyful, accessible endless runner that transforms the tension of survival into the delight of mastery.**

### The One-Sentence Pitch
"Help Rusty the Otter navigate an ever-changing river, collecting treasures and riding the flow—where every run teaches you something new, and every obstacle overcome feels like a personal victory."

### What Makes This Game FUN
1. **The Flow State:** When you're dodging rocks perfectly, the game enters a meditative flow
2. **Progressive Mastery:** Each run makes you slightly better at reading the river
3. **Joyful Failure:** When you hit a rock, Rusty's reaction is endearing, not punishing
4. **Collectible Satisfaction:** The *clink* of coins and the visual feedback create micro-rewards
5. **Biome Discovery:** Reaching new river sections feels like exploration
6. **Personal Achievement:** Unlocking achievements creates meaningful milestones

## 🎨 Visual Design Language - "What You See is What You Get"

### Core Visual Principles
1. **Clarity Over Beauty:** Gameplay elements must be instantly recognizable
2. **Readability:** High contrast between obstacles and background
3. **Cartoon Cohesion:** Every element matches the illustrated style
4. **Motion Clarity:** Easy to track fast-moving objects
5. **Feedback:** Every action has visual consequence

### Critical Visual Hierarchy
```
FOREGROUND (MOST IMPORTANT)
├─ Rusty (the player)
│  └─ Always visible, always centered
├─ Obstacles (rocks)
│  └─ Dark, thick outlines, clear shapes
├─ Collectibles (coins, gems)
│  └─ Bright, animated, eye-catching
└─ Power-ups
   └─ Glowing, distinct silhouettes

MIDGROUND
├─ River surface (water texture)
├─ Water splashes and particles
└─ Lane dividers (subtle)

BACKGROUND
├─ Biome scenery (trees, cliffs)
├─ Sky gradient
└─ Parallax elements (depth)

OVERLAY (UI)
├─ Score counter (top center)
├─ Coin counter (top left)
└─ Pause button (top right)
```

### Animation Principles
- **Anticipation:** Rusty leans before switching lanes
- **Squash & Stretch:** Objects compress on impact
- **Follow-through:** Water trails behind Rusty
- **Easing:** Nothing moves linearly (always ease in/out)

## 🎯 Difficulty Design - "Easy to Learn, Hard to Master"

### Difficulty Curve Philosophy
```
PLAYER SKILL
    ↑
    │           ┌─────  Skill Ceiling (Mastery)
    │         ┌─┘
    │       ┌─┘
    │     ┌─┘
    │   ┌─┘

    │     └─┐  Boredom (Too Easy)
    └───────────────────────────────────────→
                    GAME TIME
```

### Difficulty Scaling Rules
1. **First 30 seconds:** Cannot die (tutorial zone)
2. **30s - 2min:** Gentle introduction (single obstacles)
3. **2-5min:** Pattern introduction (pairs, triplets)
4. **5-10min:** Expert patterns (clusters, timing)
5. **10min+:** Mastery required (tight timing, complex)

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)
**Watches for:**
- Too many deaths quickly: Scale back 10%
- Perfect run: Scale up 5%
- Long survival: Gradually increase
- Player struggling: Add more power-ups

**NEVER:**
- Make it impossible
- Punish skill (no rubber-banding)
- Make it obvious (player shouldn't notice)

## 📐 Core Design Decisions (Frozen)

### Decision 1: Lane-Based Movement
**Why:** Clearer decision-making, mobile-friendly, readable patterns  
**Alternative Considered:** Free movement (rejected: too chaotic on mobile)

### Decision 2: Vertical Scrolling
**Why:** Natural read direction, mobile portrait, visibility ahead  
**Alternative Considered:** Horizontal (rejected: mobile orientation issues)

### Decision 3: No Lives System
**Why:** Removes meta-game friction, immediate replay encourages mastery  
**Alternative Considered:** 3-lives system (rejected: adds frustration)

### Decision 4: Local-Only Leaderboards
**Why:** Privacy-first, no accounts, no cheating concerns  
**Alternative Considered:** Global leaderboards (rejected: requires backend)
