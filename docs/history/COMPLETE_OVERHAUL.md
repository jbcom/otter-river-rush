## üéØ KEY IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Magnet Power-Up (Most Requested!)
```typescript
// Pulls nearby coins/gems towards otter
if (magnetActive && dist < MAGNET_CONFIG.RADIUS) {
  const pullSpeed = 400; // coins
  const dx = otterCenterX - coinCenterX;
  coin.x += (dx / mag) * pullSpeed * deltaTime;
}
```

### 2. Game Mode Architecture
```typescript
start(mode: GameMode = GameMode.CLASSIC): void {
  this.gameMode = mode;
  
  if (mode === GameMode.ZEN) {
    this.scrollSpeed *= 0.6; // Slower, relaxing
  }
  
  this.generator.setGameMode(mode);
}
```

### 3. Collectible System
```typescript
// Coins boost score and combo
this.coins += coin.value;
this.score += coin.value * 10;
this.combo++;

// Gems boost score even more!
this.gems += gem.value;
this.score += gem.value * 50;
this.combo += 2; // Bigger combo boost
```

### 4. Achievement Popups
```typescript
// Queue and display achievements one at a time
private showNextAchievement(): void {
  const achievement = this.achievementQueue.shift()!;
  this.achievementPopup.classList.remove('hidden');
  
  // Auto-hide after 4 seconds, show next if any
  window.setTimeout(() => {
    this.achievementPopup.classList.add('hidden');
    if (this.achievementQueue.length > 0) {
      window.setTimeout(() => this.showNextAchievement(), 500);
    }
  }, 4000);
}
```
