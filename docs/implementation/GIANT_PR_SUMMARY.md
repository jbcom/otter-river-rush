## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### 1. Dependency Upgrades ✅

#### Major Upgrades
```json
{
  "vite": "^5.4.0" → "^7.1.12",
  "vite-plugin-pwa": "^0.21.0" → "^1.1.0",
  "vitest": "^2.0.0" → "^4.0.3",
  "@vitest/ui": "^2.0.0" → "^4.0.3",
  "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^2.0.0" → "^4.0.3"
}
```

#### Security Impact
- **Before**: 7 moderate vulnerabilities
- **After**: 0 vulnerabilities ✅
- **Critical Fix**: esbuild vulnerability in Vite dependency chain

#### Removed Deprecated
```json
{
  "removed": ["@types/sharp@^0.32.0"]
}
```
**Reason**: Sharp 0.34+ includes built-in TypeScript types

---

### 2. TypeScript Build Fixes ✅

#### Fixed 6 Critical Errors

**Issue**: `PowerUpType.SPEED_BOOST` renamed to `CONTROL_BOOST`
- Fixed in: `Game.ts`, `ProceduralGenerator.ts`, `Renderer.ts`, `UIRenderer.ts`, `SpriteFactory.ts`
- **Impact**: Build was completely broken

**Issue**: Missing `ImportMeta.env` type declarations
- Created: `src/vite-env.d.ts`
- **Impact**: Vite environment variables now fully typed

**Result**: 
```bash
✅ tsc: 0 errors
✅ vite build: SUCCESS
✅ All tests: PASSING
```

---

### 3. Audio System Enhancement ✅

#### Added Volume Control
**New Method** in `AudioManager.ts`:
```typescript
setVolume(volume: number): void {
  const clampedVolume = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, volume));
  this.sounds.forEach((sound) => {
    sound.volume(clampedVolume);
  });
}
```

**Wired to Settings UI**:
```typescript
volumeSlider.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
  const value = parseInt(e.value) / 100;
  SettingsManager.updateSetting('volume', value);
  this.audioManager.setVolume(value); // ← NEW!
});
```

**Impact**: Volume slider now functional, fixes TODO in Game.ts

---

### 4. Code Cleanup ✅

#### Removed Outdated TODOs
- ❌ "TODO: Implement daily challenge generation" (already implemented)
- ❌ "TODO: Update audio volume" (now implemented)

#### Lint Fixes
- Fixed `setTimeout` → `window.setTimeout` in ResponsiveCanvas
- Added ESLint disable for CommonJS `require` in tailwind.config.js
- Improved TypeScript any-type handling with proper comments

---

### 5. Documentation ✅

#### Updated README.md
**Changes**:
- `yourusername` → `jbcom` (3 locations)
- Deployment URL: `https://jbcom.github.io/otter-river-rush/`
- All badges now point to correct repository

#### Created REACT_MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md
**New comprehensive 800+ line document covering**:
- Complete migration plan (6 phases, 6 weeks)
- Architecture comparison (Canvas2D → R3F)
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Code examples for every component
- State management with Zustand
- Performance optimization strategies
- Testing strategies
- Risk mitigation plans
- Success metrics
- Timeline and milestones

---

### 6. Platform Support ✅

#### Capacitor Initialization
```bash
$ npm run cap:sync
✔ copy web in 12.03ms
✔ update web in 6.17ms
[info] Sync finished in 0.06s
```

**Status**: Ready for mobile testing (Android/iOS)

**Note**: Platform directories (android/, ios/) not yet created - requires:
