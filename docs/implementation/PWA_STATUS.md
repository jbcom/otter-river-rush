## 🎨 Branding in PWA

### Updated Manifest
```json
{
  "name": "Otter River Rush - Rusty's Adventure",
  "short_name": "OtterRush",
  "description": "Join Rusty the Otter on a wild river adventure!",
  "display": "fullscreen",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "theme_color": "#0f172a",
  "background_color": "#0f172a",
  "categories": ["games", "action"]
}
```

### Icons
- ✅ `pwa-192x192.png` - Home screen icon
- ✅ `pwa-512x512.png` - Splash screen
- ✅ `apple-touch-icon.png` - iOS icon
- ✅ `favicon.ico` - Browser tab

---

## 🚀 What Gets Cached

### Assets (Offline Access)
```
✅ Game code (JS/CSS)
✅ HTML pages
✅ All sprites (otter, rocks, coins, gems)
✅ HUD images (buttons, panels, splash screen)
✅ Icons and favicons
✅ Audio files (if you add them)
```

### Strategy
- **CacheFirst** for fonts (1 year cache)
- **Auto-caching** for all game assets
- **3.5MB limit** (plenty for your game)
- **Runtime caching** for external resources

---

## 🎮 PWA Capabilities

### What Works Offline
- ✅ **Full game** - play without internet
- ✅ **All assets** - sprites, UI, sounds
- ✅ **High scores** - stored locally
- ✅ **Settings** - persisted

### What Needs Internet
- ❌ Leaderboards (if you add server sync)
- ❌ Daily challenges (if server-based)
- ❌ Multiplayer (future feature)

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### Service Worker (Workbox)
```javascript
// Auto-generated by Vite PWA plugin
- Precaches all game assets on install
- Updates automatically in background
- Serves from cache (offline-first)
- Handles navigation fallbacks
```

### Vite PWA Plugin Config
```typescript
VitePWA({
  registerType: 'autoUpdate',
  workbox: {
    maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes: 3.5 * 1024 * 1024,
    globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg,jpg,mp3,ogg}'],
    runtimeCaching: [/* font caching */]
  }
})
```

---

## 🧪 Testing PWA Features

### Desktop Chrome
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. **Application** tab
3. Check:
   - ✅ Manifest

### Lighthouse Audit
