# Active Context - Otter River Rush

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26  
**Current Branch**: cursor/asset-pipeline-and-quality-assurance-overhaul-d47a  
**Session Status**: 🎨 ASSET PIPELINE & QUALITY ASSURANCE OVERHAUL

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Task: Asset Pipeline & Quality Assurance System ✨
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-10-26

**Objectives**:
1. Create comprehensive asset manifest with quality metrics
2. Build idempotent post-processor with automatic quality evaluation
3. Implement transparency/background fill detection
4. Add aspect ratio preservation and scale quality checks
5. Create format-specific handlers (PNG, ICO, WebP)
6. Verify content generation idempotency (enemies, levels)
7. Auto-regenerate deficient assets
8. Make asset tooling production-grade

**Rationale**: With 5MB limit removed, time for thorough asset quality assessment. Assets are the lifeblood of this visual game - tooling must be robust, automated, and production-ready.

### Previous Task: CI/CD Consolidation + Semantic Release Automation ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Completed**: 2025-10-26

**Objectives Accomplished**:
1. ✅ Fixed bundle size issue (7.1MB → 4.2MB, 41% reduction)
   - Implemented adaptive PNG compression in process-icons.ts
   - Optimized 37 PNG assets across sprites/icons/hud
2. ✅ Consolidated 4 separate workflows into unified ci-cd.yml
   - Removed release.yml, desktop-build.yml, mobile-build.yml
   - Single workflow with intelligent gating logic
3. ✅ Implemented automated semantic versioning
   - Added semantic-release to auto-release job
   - Configures .releaserc.json for version bumping
   - Automatic changelog generation
   - Tags created and pushed automatically
4. ✅ Fixed conditional dependency bug in create-release job
   - Added always() condition to handle skipped platform builds
   - Release job runs even if Android/Desktop builds are disabled
   - Graceful artifact handling with continue-on-error

**Rationale**: 
- Bundle size was blocking CI/CD (exceeded 5MB limit)
- Multiple workflows created maintenance burden
- Manual version tagging is error-prone and slow
- Need full automation for semantic versioning and releases

## Recent Changes

### CI/CD Unification + Automated Releases (2025-10-26) ✅
**Completed**: Unified CI/CD workflow with semantic versioning automation

**What Was Done**:

#### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
- **Modified `scripts/process-icons.ts`**:
  - Adaptive PNG compression based on file size
  - >300KB: 60% quality, >200KB: 70% quality, ≤200KB: 85% quality
  - Added effort: 10 for maximum compression
  - Extracted constants for maintainability
- **Result**: 7.1MB → 4.2MB (41% reduction, 1MB margin under 5MB limit)

#### 2. Workflow Consolidation
- **Unified `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**:
  - Consolidated 4 workflows into 1 with gating logic
  - PR: Fast validation only (lint, type-check, test, build) ~3 min
  - Push to main: Full CI + E2E + auto-deploy to Pages + semantic-release ~9 min
  - Version tags: Everything (CI + Android + Desktop + GitHub Release) ~25 min
  - Manual dispatch: Configurable options for selective builds
- **Removed workflows**: release.yml, desktop-build.yml, mobile-build.yml
- **Single source of truth**: All CI/CD/deployment in one file

#### 3. Automated Semantic Releases
- **Added `auto-release` job** to ci-cd.yml:
  - Runs after successful main pushes (after deploy-web)
  - Uses semantic-release with cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4
  - Analyzes commits using conventional commit format
  - Automatically calculates next version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - Generates CHANGELOG.md entries
  - Creates and pushes git tags
  - Comments on included PRs/issues
  
- **Created `.releaserc.json`**:
  - Conventional commits preset configuration
  - Release rules: feat→MINOR, fix→PATCH, BREAKING→MAJOR
  - Changelog generation with emoji sections
  - NPM publish disabled (not a library)
  - Git plugin for committing CHANGELOG.md
  - GitHub plugin for release creation
  
- **Created `.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`**:
  - Comprehensive guide for conventional commits
  - Examples for each commit type
  - Explanation of version bumping logic
  - Best practices and tools

#### 4. Fixed Conditional Dependency Bug
- **Fixed `create-release` job** in ci-cd.yml:
  - Added `always()` condition to run even if deps skipped
  - Check `needs.build-web.result == 'success'` to ensure web build passed
  - Added `continue-on-error: true` to artifact download
  - Now handles missing Android/Desktop artifacts gracefully
  - Manual dispatch with selective platform builds works correctly

## How Automated Releases Work

### Flow on Push to Main
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Runs** (~9 min total)
   - Lint, type-check, test, build-web
   - E2E tests
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - **Semantic Release Analysis**:
     - Analyzes commits since last release
     - Determines version bump (feat→MINOR, fix→PATCH, BREAKING→MAJOR)
     - Generates changelog
     - Updates package.json version
     - Creates git tag (e.g., v1.2.0)
     - Pushes tag to GitHub
     - Commits CHANGELOG.md back to main [skip ci]

2. **Tag Triggers Platform Builds** (~15-20 min)
   - Android APK build
   - Desktop builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Create GitHub Release with all artifacts
   - Attach generated CHANGELOG to release notes

### Conventional Commit Examples
```bash
# MINOR version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
git commit -m "feat(game): add power-up system"

# PATCH version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
git commit -m "fix(collision): prevent fall-through"

# MAJOR version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change config format

BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration now uses YAML"

# No release (chore commits don't trigger releases)
git commit -m "docs: update readme [skip ci]"
```
