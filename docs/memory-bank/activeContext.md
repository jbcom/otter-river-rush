# Active Context - Otter River Rush

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26  
**Current Branch**: copilot/refactor-image-processing-pipeline  
**Session Status**: üîß CI/CD WORKFLOW FIX + ASSET PIPELINE REFINEMENT

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Task: Fix CI/CD Content Generation Gap ‚úÖ
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Started**: 2025-10-26

**Problem Identified**:
- AI-generated content (level patterns, enemy AI, sprites) was NOT regenerated in CI/CD
- Deployments used stale, manually-committed content
- No automated asset pipeline in workflows

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added content generation step to `build-web` job in ci-cd.yml
- Runs on main branch pushes only (to save API costs)
- Generates: game content (Claude), sprites (OpenAI), asset pipeline
- Gracefully handles missing API keys (continues with committed files)
- `continue-on-error: true` prevents build failures

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
   - Added "Generate fresh content" step before build
   - Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` secrets
   - Runs `generate-content`, `generate-sprites`, `asset-pipeline`
   - Only on main branch to avoid API costs on PRs

2. Fixed asset-post-processor.ts bug:
   - Adaptive quality re-processing now uses PNG format (line 206)
   - Previous bug: used `targetFormat` which broke ICO/WebP/JPG
   - Now explicitly uses `'png'` for reliable file size reduction

3. Fixed ICO format handling:
   - Removed redundant `.resize(32, 32)` (already done in setupPipeline)
   - Changed hardcoded `quality: 90` to dynamic `quality` parameter
   - Added `effort: 10` for consistency with PNG case

4. Added exhaustive type check:
   - Default case now throws error if unsupported format
   - Compile-time safety for format additions

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Fresh AI content generated on every main branch deployment
- ‚úÖ Asset pipeline runs automatically
- ‚úÖ Works without API keys (uses committed files)
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing workflows

### Secondary Task: Asset Post-Processor Refinement ‚úÖ
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed adaptive quality bug (now uses PNG for re-processing)
- Fixed ICO format handling (dynamic quality, no redundant resize)
- Added exhaustive type checking for format switch
- Added comprehensive JSDoc to `applyFormatConversion`

### Release System Investigation üîç
**Status**: INVESTIGATING

**Known Facts**:
- Latest release: v1.0.4 (2025-10-26T21:07:49Z)
- semantic-release configured correctly in .releaserc.json
- auto-release job exists in ci-cd.yml
- Last CI/CD run: 18824922683 (success)

**Need to Investigate**:
- Why releases aren't triggering consistently
- Check semantic-release logs
- Verify commit message format compliance
- Check if platform-builds are completing

## Recent Changes

### CI/CD Content Generation Integration (2025-10-26) ‚úÖ
**Completed**: Integrated AI content generation into build process

**What Was Done**:

#### 1. Added Content Generation to Build Job
- **Modified `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**:
  - New step in `build-web` job after npm ci
  - Runs on main branch only (`if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`)
  - Generates fresh content before build
  - Uses existing secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - Falls back to committed files if generation fails
  
- **What Gets Generated**:
  - Enemy AI behaviors and definitions (Claude)
  - Level patterns and obstacles (Claude)
  - Achievements and loading tips (Claude)
  - Otter and obstacle sprites (OpenAI)
  - HUD elements and UI icons (OpenAI)
  - Asset pipeline optimization (idempotent)

#### 2. Fixed Asset Post-Processor Bugs
- **scripts/asset-post-processor.ts**:
  - Line 206: Adaptive quality now uses `'png'` explicitly
  - Lines 129-134: Fixed ICO format handling
    - Removed redundant resize
    - Dynamic quality parameter
    - Added effort: 10
  - Lines 136-139: Added exhaustive type check
    - Throws on unsupported format
    - Compile-time safety

#### 3. Cleaned Up Documentation Bloat
- Deleted unnecessary workflow documentation files
- Removed example workflows (secrets already integrated!)
- Kept only essential docs

**Rationale**:
- Asset quality is critical for visual game
- AI-generated content must stay fresh
- Automated pipeline reduces manual errors
- Cost-optimized (runs only on main, not PRs)

## How Content Generation Works Now

### Flow on Push to Main
```
Push to main
  ‚Üì
CI (lint, test, type-check) - parallel
  ‚Üì
build-web job:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Generate fresh content ‚ú® (NEW!)
     - npm run generate-content (Claude API)
     - npm run generate-sprites (OpenAI API)
     - npm run asset-pipeline (optimization)
  3. Build project (uses fresh content)
  4. Upload dist/ artifact
  ‚Üì
E2E + Visual Tests
  ‚Üì
Deploy to GitHub Pages
  ‚Üì
Auto-release (semantic versioning)
  ‚Üì
Platform Builds (if new version)
```

### Cost Management
- Only runs on main branch (not PRs)
- Estimated cost: $1-2 per deployment
  - OpenAI: ~$1.50 (sprites, icons)
  - Anthropic: ~$0.15 (game data)
- Fails gracefully if API keys missing

## Previous Work (2025-10-26)

### CI/CD Consolidation + Semantic Release Automation ‚úÖ
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Completed**: 2025-10-26

**Objectives Accomplished**:
1. ‚úÖ Fixed bundle size issue (7.1MB ‚Üí 4.2MB, 41% reduction)
   - Implemented adaptive PNG compression in process-icons.ts
   - Optimized 37 PNG assets across sprites/icons/hud
2. ‚úÖ Consolidated 4 separate workflows into unified ci-cd.yml
   - Removed release.yml, desktop-build.yml, mobile-build.yml
   - Single workflow with intelligent gating logic
3. ‚úÖ Implemented automated semantic versioning
   - Added semantic-release to auto-release job
   - Configured .releaserc.json for version bumping
   - Automatic changelog generation
   - Tags created and pushed automatically
4. ‚úÖ Fixed conditional dependency bug in create-release job
   - Added always() condition to handle skipped platform builds
   - Release job runs even if Android/Desktop builds are disabled
   - Graceful artifact handling with continue-on-error

## Next Steps

### Immediate - Investigate Release Issues
1. Check recent workflow runs for auto-release job
2. Verify commit messages follow conventional format
3. Check semantic-release logs for errors
4. Test manual release trigger if needed

### Short-term - Monitor Content Generation
1. Watch next main branch push for content generation
2. Verify fresh content is generated and built
3. Check API costs in OpenAI/Anthropic dashboards
4. Ensure asset quality remains high

### Medium-term - Phase 2 Production Migration
1. Complete Tailwind UI conversion
2. Test responsive design on multiple devices
3. Begin React Three Fiber migration
4. Setup AI asset generation pipeline

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Content Generation Pattern
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Graceful Failure**: Continues with committed files if APIs fail
- **Cost-Optimized**: Only on main branch, not PRs
- **Transparent**: Clear logging of what's generated

### Asset Pipeline Pattern
- **Quality-First**: Adaptive quality ensures file size targets
- **Format-Specific**: Different handling for PNG, ICO, WebP, JPG
- **Exhaustive Checking**: Compile-time safety for new formats
- **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times safely
