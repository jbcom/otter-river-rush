# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests that verify core game logic
BEFORE platform-specific builds (Capacitor, Electron).

## What to Test Here

- Game state management and transitions
- Physics and collision detection
- Scoring and progression systems
- Asset loading and management
- Audio system integration
- Input handling (game logic, not platform controls)

## Why Integration Tests Matter

These tests run BEFORE the codebase branches into web/mobile/desktop builds.
They verify the GAME works, independent of platform wrappers.

Platform wrappers (Capacitor/Electron) just package this already-tested code.

## Example Tests Needed

- `game-flow.test.ts` - Complete game lifecycle
- `collision.test.ts` - Collision detection accuracy
- `scoring.test.ts` - Score calculation correctness
- `state-management.test.ts` - Game state transitions
- `asset-loading.test.ts` - Asset system reliability

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

These tests run automatically in the Integration Tests workflow
before ANY platform builds are triggered.
